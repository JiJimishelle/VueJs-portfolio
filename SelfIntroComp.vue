      Among all the languages that I have learned, Korean attracted me the most. Studying in the Republic of Korea 
      made me realize there is a lot to learn from its culture and the personalities of its people.  Korean cultural
      characteristics  influenced the  relationship between people  and  made them bound. It seems to me that people's 
      passion for  education has led to rapid  development.  Furthermore,  South Korea's highly  regarded  Information 
      Technology will help me obtain a high education.

      My childhood  dream was to be a cashier.  In comparison, other kids dreamed about being a teacher or police
      officers.  I always  loved to play supermarket  games with  my mother. I find it  interesting  to count numbers
      and add in  the total. That led me to perform  rudimentary  arithmetic operations  naturally at four years old.
      Moreover, I learned money counting and how to manage  my finance. Then, I asked my Mongolian Linguist mother 
      to teach me how to read. As a result, I started going to school a year earlier. First year of elementary school,
      I won first place in the district  mathematics Olympiad. Then I became one of the school's top students whose 
      portrait  gets on the honor board.  Since then, my priority  has always been to acquire an advanced education. 
      Although  this was  important to me, I also knew that  participating in clubs, sports, and  extracurricular
      activities would benefit me in becoming a well-rounded student.

      In 5th grade, I became interested in Korean culture through K-pop and K-dramas. Since then, I have started
      watching and mimicking  '1 million dance studio'  dancers' choreography, especially Lia Kim. However, I only 
      could learn the Korean alphabet Hangul and a few phrases by searching google. In 6th grade, I needed to transfer
      to a Chinese language private school with my younger sister when she entered 1st grade. I started to focus on my
      Chinese to surpass my classmates and to be able to talk to my Chinese teacher. On the one hand, participating 
      individually or as a team in various Chinese competitions organized by the Confucius Institute at the National 
      University of Mongolia made me  interested in other cultures and  languages. Other hand, it helped me better
      at time management skills to maintain good grades while participating in extracurricular activities and family
      affairs.  Having been away from  home to foreign countries  several times since I was a kid has made me more 
      independent and increased my parents' faith in me. In particular, the two-week study trip to China at the age 
      of 12. From the 2nd year of high school, I started attending a new school to further my mathematics studies and 
      practice Judo for self-defense. Not only judo taught me self-defense, but it also developed positive attitudes 
      about sports and increased my self-discipline and courtesy toward others. And mathematics was the only escape 
      from overthinking.

      I am a quick learner, efficient, I never complain, and realistic. I believe that I have acquired competitive 
      behavior, leadership, and  communication skills,  during school events. For instance, under  my leadership, our 
      class won first place in the talent competition between university and high school students.  We also used to 
      do volunteering by ourselves. I love challenges --- many times, life has shown me  uncountable  impossibilities. 
      Even though  I was  passionate and able to grow,  finance was one of the factors that  required me to get the 
      education I desired. Instead of sitting back, I decided to do something on my own. I wanted for a few years 
      to attend a memory training course at  the Mongolian Intellectual academy, to be a memory athlete.  During the 
      summer vacation, I worked as a part-time teacher at a language training center. I have learned a lot and gained
      a lot of experience by teaching the basics of English to people of different ages. It even changed someone's 
      perspective. Little by little, I earned the respect of my students through my skills and hard work. As a 
      consequence, I used my earnings to invest in myself. I had a great chance to cooperate with many other outstanding
      individuals and share what I know at the Mongolian Memory Championship by doing external judger. The volunteers 
      played an essential role in reviewing and evaluating the "recall sheets" of the memory athletes. It made me try to
      see problems from different aspects instead of complaining.

      The presence of well-educated family members was one of the aspects that strengthened my confidence. Even 
      though my family is not that wealthy, when it comes to education, they try to do their best to provide me 
      with a good education. Sometimes it puts me under a lot of pressure, but I think it's the factor that affects 
      my consistency and helps me to accomplish tasks on unmotivated days. I believe being the eldest daughter of a
      family with three siblings made me responsibly, maturely, and considerately. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I 
      needed  to take care of my three  younger sisters while our parents were working and on business trips to the 
      countryside. Doing all the housework while taking classes online was difficult because two of my three sisters 
      were little. In other words, I am their second mother. For that reason, I must step forward regardless of any 
      difficulties. I want to be a great sister who can support them to be able to use their full potential.

      My current research has led me to become more interested in artificial intelligence. It was hard to imagine 
      the human future without it. I find it intriguing how fast society is being shaped and continues to be under the 
      influence of Computer Science. Computer science is a career that fires up my curiosity and leverages my intellect,
      allowing me to expand my prowess as I tackle meaningful challenges and problems. By studying in Korea I can 
      serve as a link between Korea and Mongolia, and many other countries by making my dream come true.
